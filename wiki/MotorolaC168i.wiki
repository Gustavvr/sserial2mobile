On the top of the C168i is a 3/32 mini stereo jack.  This is also can be used as "hands-free" connection , but not both at the same time.  These 3/32 jack are usualy stocked at Radio Shack [http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062449&cp=&sr=1&origkw=3%2F32&kw=3%2F32&parentPage=search 3/32" Stereo Plug]

The solder point on the 3/32 plug are very small so it is probaby a good idea to chack for shorts with a multimeter.  

In the picture I have used Ethernet CAT5 wire.  This is really not the best choice as it is not flexible but I just happen to have a lot of it around.

I will expand on this later but for now:
